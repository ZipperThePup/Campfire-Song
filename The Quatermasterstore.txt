There are rats, rats, rats, 
Big as alley cats
In the store, in the store,
There are rats, rats, rats, 
Big as alley cats
In the Quartermaster's Store.

(Chorus)
My eyes are dim, I cannot see,
I have not brought my specs with me!
I have not brought my specs with me!

There are mice, mice, mice
Running through the rice,
In the store! In the store! 
There are mice, mice, mice, 
Running through the rice, 
At the Quartermaster's store.
